# Ableton Live API for Node.js (through Max for Live)

This module exposes the [Live Object Model](https://cycling74.com/docs/max6/dynamic/c74_docs.html#live_object_model)
so that it can be consumed directly from Node.js. It works by communicating with a Max for Live device (included in the repo)
through udp sockets.


### Requirements

* Ableton Live 9
* Max for Live (tested with version 7, might work with 6)

By default, the module binds on ports __9000__ and __9001__, so they need to be free.


### Install

`npm install max4node`


### Setup

The Max for Live device is located in `max_device/max4node.amxd`.  
Drop the device in a MIDI track (doesn't matter which one).


### Usage

```javascript
var Max4Node = require('max4node');

var max = new Max4Node();
max.bind();
```

##### Get values

Get Master Track volume.

```javascript
max.get({
  path: 'live_set master_track mixer_device volume',
  property: 'value'
})
.on('value', function(val) {
  console.log('Master track volume: ' + val);
});
```

##### Set values

Arm the first track.

```javascript
max.set({
  path: 'live_set tracks 0',
  property: 'arm',
  value: true
});
```

##### Call functions

Play a clip.

```javascript
max.call({
  path: 'live_set tracks 0 clip_slots 3 clip',
  method: 'fire'
});
```

##### Observe a value

Fire the callback with the updated position of the clip (if it's playing).

```javascript
max.observe({
  path: 'live_set 0 clip_slots 3 clip',
  property: 'playing_position'
})
.on('value', function(val) {
  console.log('Playing position: ' + val);
});
```

##### Count

Number of clips in the track.

```javascript
max.count({
  path: 'live_set tracks 0',
  property: 'clip_slots'
})
.on('value', function(count) {
  console.log(count + ' clips');
});
```

##### Promises

Promise based versions of `get` and `count` are available through `max.promise()`.

```javascript
max.promise().get({
  path: 'live_set master_track mixer_device volume',
  property: 'value'
})
.then(function(val) {
  console.log('Master track volume: ' + val);
});

max.promise().count({
  path: 'live_set tracks 0',
  property: 'clip_slots'
})
.then(function(count) {
  console.log(count + ' clips');
});
```

### Testing

Testing is done with fake sockets, so you don't need to open Ableton and Max.

`npm test`


### Big ups

I would have never been able to come up with the Max device without looking at the code of [Fingz](http://www.atmosphery.com/#fingz), an awesome project that you should definitely check out.  
I learned a lot about Max from it, debugging in Max is as painful as listening to Justin Bieber, but it's the only
way we have to access the Ableton API in a reliable manner (control surfaces programming is a joke, and
not officially supported).
